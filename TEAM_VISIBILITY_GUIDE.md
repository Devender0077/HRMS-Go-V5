# 📋 Calendar Event Visibility Guide

## 🎯 What is "Team" Visibility?

When you select **"Team"** visibility for a calendar event, it means the event will ONLY be visible to employees who are in the **same department** as you.

## 🔐 How Visibility Options Work:

### 🌍 **Everyone**
- **Who can see:** All employees in the organization
- **Use for:** Company-wide events, holidays, announcements
- **Example:** "Company Annual Day", "Diwali Holiday"

### 👥 **Team** 
- **Who can see:** Only employees in your department/team
- **Automatically determined by:** Your department (from employee profile)
- **Use for:** Team meetings, department events
- **Example:** "Engineering Team Standup", "HR Department Review"
- **No need to select people!** The system automatically shows it to your department members only.

### 💼 **HR Only**
- **Who can see:** Only HR team members (HR, HR Manager, Super Admin)
- **Use for:** HR meetings, policy discussions
- **Example:** "Recruitment Planning Meeting"

### ⭐ **Managers Only**
- **Who can see:** Only managers and above (Manager, HR Manager, Super Admin)
- **Use for:** Management meetings, strategy sessions
- **Example:** "Quarterly Strategy Review"

### 🔒 **Private**
- **Who can see:** Only you (the creator)
- **Use for:** Personal reminders, private appointments
- **Example:** "Doctor Appointment", "Personal Task"

## 💡 How "Team" Works (Automatic!):

1. When YOU create an event with "Team" visibility
2. System checks YOUR department (e.g., "Engineering")
3. Event becomes visible to ALL employees in "Engineering" department
4. Employees in other departments (HR, Finance, etc.) cannot see it

**You don't need to select team members manually!**  
The system automatically uses department information.

## 📝 Examples:

### Scenario 1: Engineering Team Meeting
- **Creator:** John (Engineering Department)
- **Visibility:** Team
- **Who can see:** All employees in Engineering department
- **Who cannot see:** HR, Finance, Sales employees

### Scenario 2: Company Holiday
- **Creator:** HR Manager
- **Visibility:** Everyone
- **Who can see:** Everyone in the company

### Scenario 3: HR Strategy Meeting
- **Creator:** HR Manager
