## 💡 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Pusher Architecture:
```
Backend (Node.js)                Frontend (React)
┌─────────────────┐             ┌──────────────────┐
│ Pusher Service  │◄───────────►│ Pusher Context   │
│ - Initialize    │   Channels  │ - Subscribe      │
│ - Send events   │             │ - Listen events  │
└─────────────────┘             └──────────────────┘
        │                                │
        │ Reads config from DB           │ Gets config via API
        ▼                                ▼
┌─────────────────┐             ┌──────────────────┐
│ integration_    │             │ /api/settings/   │
│ pusher table    │             │ integrations     │
└─────────────────┘             └──────────────────┘
```

### Notification Flow:
1. Event occurs (leave approved, payroll generated, etc.)
2. Backend creates notification in database
3. Backend sends to Pusher via pusherService
4. Pusher broadcasts to user's channel
5. Frontend receives instantly via PusherProvider
6. Toast notification shows
7. Notification list updates automatically
