## üéØ How It Works

### Scenario 1: Creating New Employee

**Before:**
- Employee created WITHOUT user account
- HR had to manually go to Users page
- Manual linking required
- Employee couldn't login

**Now:**
1. HR creates employee via form
2. HR can optionally set temporary password (or leave empty)
3. Backend automatically:
   - Creates employee record
   - Generates random password (if not provided)
   - Determines role from designation
   - Creates user account
   - Links `employee.user_id` = `user.id`
   - Sends welcome email
4. Employee can login immediately!

### Scenario 2: Grant Access to Existing Employee

1. HR opens Employee List
2. Finds employee with "No Access" badge
3. Clicks ‚ãÆ ‚Üí "Grant System Access"
4. System creates user account and sends credentials
5. Employee can now login!

### Scenario 3: Revoke Access

1. HR opens Employee List
2. Finds employee with "Active" badge
3. Clicks ‚ãÆ ‚Üí "Revoke System Access"
4. User account deactivated (employee data retained)
5. Employee cannot login anymore

---

## üí° Smart Role Assignment

The system automatically determines the user role based on the employee's designation:

| Designation Contains | Assigned Role | Role ID |
|---------------------|---------------|---------|
| "HR" + "Manager" | `hr_manager` | 2 |
| "HR" | `hr` | 3 |
| "Manager" | `manager` | 4 |
| "Admin" | `admin` | 6 |
| "Accountant" | `accountant` | 7 |
| **All Others** | `employee` | 5 (default) |

**Examples:**
- "HR Manager" ‚Üí `hr_manager`
- "Senior Software Engineer" ‚Üí `employee`
- "Finance Manager" ‚Üí `manager`
- "HR Executive" ‚Üí `hr`
- "System Administrator" ‚Üí `admin`

---

## üîê Password Generation

**Characteristics:**
- 12 characters long
- Contains uppercase letters (A-Z, excluding I, O)
- Contains lowercase letters (a-z, excluding l, o)
- Contains numbers (2-9, excluding 0, 1)
- Contains symbols (@, #, $, %, &, *)
- Cryptographically random
- Guaranteed to have at least one character from each category

**Example Generated Password:** `Xy9#a2Bc3@de`

---

## üìß Email Notifications

### Welcome Email (on account creation)

```
Subject: Welcome to HRMS - Your Login Credentials

Hi [Employee Name],

Welcome to our HRMS system! Your account has been created.

LOGIN CREDENTIALS:
  Email: [employee.email]
  Temporary Password: [generated_password]
  Login URL: http://localhost:3000/auth/login

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: For security reasons, please change your password
   after your first login.

If you have any questions, please contact HR.

Best regards,
HR Team
```

**Current Status:** Displayed in backend console  
**To Enable Real Emails:** Configure SMTP in `backend/utils/emailService.js`

## üêõ What Was Fixed

### Original Bug

**Location:** `backend/controllers/employee.controller.js` line 332-333

**Before:**
```javascript
// TODO: Create user account if temporaryPassword is provided
// TODO: Send welcome email with credentials
```

**Problem:**
- Employee form showed password field
- Form promised "login account will be created"
- Backend did nothing - just a TODO comment
- Employee created without system access
- HR confused why employee can't login

### The Fix

**Now:**
```javascript
// Create user account for system access
let userAccount = null;
let generatedPassword = null;

try {
  const password = temporaryPassword || generateRandomPassword(12);
  generatedPassword = password;
  
  // Determine role based on designation
  let userType = 'employee';
  let roleId = 5;
  
  if (designation) {
    const [[designationData]] = await db.query(
      'SELECT name FROM designations WHERE id = ?',
      [designation]
    );
    
    if (designationData) {
      const designationName = designationData.name.toLowerCase();
      
      if (designationName.includes('hr') && designationName.includes('manager')) {
        userType = 'hr_manager';
        roleId = 2;
      } else if (designationName.includes('hr')) {
        userType = 'hr';
        roleId = 3;
      } else if (designationName.includes('manager')) {
        userType = 'manager';
        roleId = 4;
      } // ... more role mappings
    }
  }
  
  // Create user account
  userAccount = await User.create({
    name: `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
    email,
    password,
    user_type: userType,
    role_id: roleId,
    status: 'active',
  });
  
  // Link employee to user
  await employee.update({ user_id: userAccount.id });
  
  // Send welcome email
  await sendWelcomeEmail({
    to: email,
    name: `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
    email,
    password: generatedPassword,
    loginUrl: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/auth/login',
  });
  
} catch (userError) {
  console.error('‚ùå Error creating user account:', userError);
  // Don't fail employee creation if user creation fails
}
```

## üìã Database Impact

### Tables Affected:

**`users` table:**

- `user_type` and `role_id` set based on designation
- Status set to 'active'

**`employees` table:**
- `user_id` column populated with linked user ID
- Or set to `NULL` if no system access

### Sample Data:

**Before:**
```sql
-- employees table
id | employee_id | email              | user_id
1  | EMP001     | john@company.com   | NULL

-- users table
(no corresponding user)
```

**After (auto-create):**
```sql
-- employees table
id | employee_id | email              | user_id
1  | EMP001     | john@company.com   | 15

-- users table
id | email              | user_type | role_id | status
15 | john@company.com   | employee  | 5       | active
```
